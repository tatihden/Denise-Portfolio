# Machine learning (Regression with scikit learn): [KaggleX Skill Assessment Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kagglex-cohort4)
The skill assessment challenge was a component of the application and allowed the program team to validate hands-on experience in data science. Evaluation was done using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Prediction was done using [kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/denisemtatih/kagglex-cars/notebook) and SAS Enterprise miner. (Ranked 73 out of 1846 submissions)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/denisemtatih/kagglex-cars/output?select=submission4.csv).
